                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My acquaintance with the field of development and programming began with admission to the specialty of computer science and English at BSU. Even then I understood, that the computer technologies are our future, although back then in 2000 they were just beginning to develop in our country.
                        After graduating from the university, I was engaged in various activities, one way or another related to my major. And after 2011, I became interested in creating websites and then made her first own website.
                        Then I went into teaching, this is my main major, and taught maths, and later robotics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And I began to learn programming when I got a job as a programming teacher for children, which I still do. At the same time I studied algorithms and various programming languages ​​and taught them to children at a private school, and then online.
                        Since then, programming has become a part of my life forever and I was most interested in the opportunity to create websites with my own hands, from simple landing pages to multi-page cool applications.
                        What I have been studying at the present time, independently and in courses. As a teacher myself, I know and understand, how important it is to constantly develop and acquire new knowledge, especially their application in practice.
                        I believe that my dedication, love for knowledge and perseverance will help me become a great Frontend developer.
